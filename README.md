## Project Description
This repository presents a business-focused analysis of a Sales Orders dataset.  
The goal was to extract actionable insights around **Turnover (Revenue)**, **Net Income (Margin)**, **product/category performance**, and patterns across **time** and **location**.

The final output is a set of curated visuals (Power BI + Python plots) used for presentation purposes.

## Key Insights
- Identified the overall business performance using core KPIs (**Total Orders, Total Units Sold, Total Turnover, Total Net Income, Net Income Margin %**).
- Compared **Turnover vs Units Sold** across categories to separate **high-ticket** from **high-volume** product groups.
- Highlighted **Top / Bottom products by Turnover**, revealing revenue concentration and low-impact items.
- Explored time patterns (Month / Weekday / Hour) to detect peak demand windows.
- Investigated location-based performance using address/city-driven visuals.

## Visuals Included
- KPI Cards (Executive Summary)
- Turnover ($) and Units Sold by Category
- Top 3 / Bottom 3 Products by Turnover ($)
- Time-based visuals (Month / Weekday / Hour)
- Geographic visuals (City/Region map)
- Python supporting plots (trend lines, heatmaps, scatter analysis)

---

## Tools
- Power BI (visual reporting)
- Python (Pandas, Plotly) for supporting analysis and plots
- Jupyter Notebook
